## Application Server

*implement application server and web server with Gunicorn and NginX on ubuntu server
*Introduction:*
My web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that I installed
in my first web stack project.
While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to
an application server.
In this project I will add this piece to my infrastructure, plug it to my Nginx
and make it serve my Airbnb clone project.
